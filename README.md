## Mana

So, I wanna make a site for no reason other than to experiment and play around. Somewhat productive I guess.

Special thanks goes out to:
- [Liam Appelbe](https://github.com/liamappelbe) for helping refine the process and improve coloring.
- [Jacob Morgan](https://github.com/buildist) for optimization advice.
